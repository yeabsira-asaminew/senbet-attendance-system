Creating a self-signed SSL certificate for your XAMPP server will allow you to access your local web application using `https://`. However, accessing your mobile camera for QR code scanning may still face issues due to browser restrictions or the way the QR code scanning library is implemented. Below are the steps to generate a self-signed SSL certificate, configure XAMPP, and troubleshoot the mobile camera access issue.

---

### **Step 1: Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate**
1. **Install OpenSSL** (if not already installed):
   - On Windows, OpenSSL is usually included with XAMPP. You can find it in the `xampp/apache/bin` directory.
   - Alternatively, download OpenSSL from [OpenSSL's official website](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).

2. **Generate the Certificate**:
   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the `xampp/apache/bin` directory.
   - Run the following commands to generate a private key and a self-signed certificate:
     ```bash
     openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
     ```
   - Fill in the required details (e.g., Country, State, Organization, etc.).
   - This will create two files: `server.key` (private key) and `server.crt` (certificate).

3. **Move the Certificate Files**:
   - Copy `server.key` and `server.crt` to the `xampp/apache/conf/ssl` directory (create the `ssl` folder if it doesn’t exist).

### **Step 2: Configure XAMPP to Use SSL**
1. **Edit `httpd-ssl.conf`**:
   - Open the file located at `xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf`.
   - Update the following lines to point to your certificate and key:
     ```apache
     <VirtualHost _default_:443>
         DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
         ServerName localhost:443
         SSLEngine on
         SSLCertificateFile "C:/xampp/apache/conf/ssl/server.crt"
         SSLCertificateKeyFile "C:/xampp/apache/conf/ssl/server.key"
     </VirtualHost>
     ```

2. **Enable SSL in `httpd.conf`**:
   - Open `xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf`.
   - Uncomment the following line to enable the SSL module:
     ```apache
     LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
     ```
   - Also, ensure the following line is uncommented to include the SSL configuration:
     ```apache
     Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
     ```

3. **Restart Apache**:
   - Restart the Apache server from the XAMPP Control Panel.

4. **Test HTTPS**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost`. You should see a warning about the self-signed certificate. Proceed by accepting the risk.

### **Step 3: Access Your Application from a Mobile Device**
1. **Find Your PC's IP Address**:
   - Open Command Prompt and run `ipconfig`. Note the IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

2. **Access the Application**:
   - On your mobile device, open a browser and go to `https://<your-ip-address>/my-url`.
   - Accept the self-signed certificate warning.

### **Step 4: Troubleshoot Mobile Camera Access for QR Scanning**
1. **Ensure HTTPS is Used**:
   - Most browsers require HTTPS to access the camera. Since you’ve set up SSL, this should be resolved.

2. **Check Browser Permissions**:
   - When accessing the site, ensure the browser has permission to use the camera. You may need to manually allow camera access in the browser settings.

3. **Use a QR Code Library that Supports HTTPS**:
   - If you’re using a JavaScript library for QR code scanning (e.g., `jsQR` or `Instascan`), ensure it supports HTTPS and camera access.

4. **Test with a Simple QR Code Scanner**:
   - Use a simple HTML5-based QR code scanner to test camera access. Example:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>QR Code Scanner</title>
         <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsQR/1.4.0/jsQR.min.js"></script>
     </head>
     <body>
         <div>
             <video id="qr-video" width="100%" height="100%" autoplay></video>
         </div>
         <script>
             const video = document.getElementById('qr-video');
             navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: 'environment' } })
                 .then(stream => {
                     video.srcObject = stream;
                     video.play();
                 })
                 .catch(err => console.error('Error accessing camera:', err));
         </script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

5. **Debugging**:
   - Open the browser’s developer tools (on mobile) and check for errors in the console.
   - Ensure the camera is not being blocked by browser policies or extensions.

### **Step 5: Additional Configuration (Optional)**
1. **Add the Self-Signed Certificate to Trusted Certificates**:
   - On your mobile device, you can manually add the self-signed certificate to avoid the warning. This process varies by device and browser.

2. **Use a Domain Name**:
   - If possible, use a domain name (e.g., `myapp.local`) instead of an IP address. Update your `hosts` file and configure Apache accordingly.

By following these steps, you should be able to:
1. Set up a self-signed SSL certificate for XAMPP.
2. Access your local web application securely via HTTPS.
3. Troubleshoot and enable mobile camera access for QR code scanning.
